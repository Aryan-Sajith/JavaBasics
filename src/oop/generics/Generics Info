Generics: Enable types(classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining:
Classes, Interfaces, and methods.

Benefit: Eliminates the need to create multiple versions of methods/classes for various reference
data types

Bounded Types = Requiring objects of a generic class to have data of specific derived types
Example: Number... -> public class <T extends Number> MyClass {}
