Thread: A path of execution in a java program(like a virtual string)

Info:
1) Multiple threads can run concurrently
2) Each thread can execute parts of code in parallel with the main thread
3) Each thread has an execution priority(Higher > Lower)
4) Thread Priority : 0 <= p <= 10

In Practice:
1) JVM continues executing threads until:
    a) The exit method of class Runtime is called
    b) All user(non-daemon) threads have died
2) When JVM starts up, the "main" thread calls the main method
3) Daemon thread = Low priority thread that runs in background for tasks like garbage collection
