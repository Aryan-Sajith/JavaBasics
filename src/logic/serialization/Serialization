Serialization = The process of converting an object into a byte stream
(As though you are saving a file with the object's information)

Why:
1) The object's state persists after the program exits
2) Byte stream can be saved as a platform-independent file (.ser)
3) Byte stream can be sent over the internet

Steps:
1) The object class should implement Serializable interface
2) Create a FileOutputStream instance fileOut with parameter(Pathway of where to store serialized object)
3) Create ObjectOutputStream instance out with parameter(FileOutputStream instance)
4) Write the object into the file --> out.writeObject(objectName)
5) Close the OutputStreams --> out.close(); fileOut.close();

Deserialization = The reverse process of converting a byte stream into an object
(As though you are reading a file with the object's information)

Why:
1) Helps interpret the information of the serialized objects

Steps:
1) The object class should implement Serializable interface
2) Declare your object(don't instantiate) User user;
3) Create a FileInputStream instance fileIn with parameter(Pathway of serialized object)
4) Create a ObjectInputStream instance in with parameter(FileInputStream instance)
5) Read the object into the declared object from step 2(Type casting required) --> user = (User) in.readObject();
6) Close the InputStreams --> fileIn.close(); in.close();
