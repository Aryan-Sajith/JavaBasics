Exceptions: An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts
the flow of logic.

Use try {} to test potentially exceptional code and catch() {} to catch specific
types of exceptions and respond appropriately. Lastly, use catch(Exception e) to
handle any potentially forgotten exceptions.

The finally{} block is useful to close any open scanners/files.
